HTML5 Genetic Algorithm 2D Car Thingy


What is it?
-----------

The program uses a simple genetic algorithm to evolve random two-wheeled shapes into cars over generations. **This is originally from http://rednuht.org/test/simulator/** - I just added legs, more wheels and different tracks (and removed the ghost/best car, because it was harder to update with those additions).
	
Check that page for more info, or [this one (rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2/)](http://rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2/) for a newer version of their simulator, both loosely based on [BoxCar2D](http://boxcar2d.com/).

(thanks rednuht for letting me make this version public)
